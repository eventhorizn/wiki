## How Mortgages Work

* A mortgage is a secured loan with your home as collateral
  * Lender will hold the title to the property until the loan is paid in full
* You make payments each month, including interest, until it's paid off
* Once paid off, lender gives you the title to the property

There are 4 major decisions to make with a mortgage

1. The Lender
2. The Loan Type
3. Loan Term
4. Interest Rate Type

   **The Lender**

Usually a bank or credit union

### Mortgage Loan Types

**2 Major Types**

1. Goverment-backed
   * We won't be going w/ a FHA due to high FICA
2. Conventional
   * Contract b/t homebuyers and private lenders
   * Typically require a down payment from 5 to 20 percent
     * Some offer loans w/ 3%
   * Must but PHI \(private mortgate insurance\) which pays lender if you default
     * Goes away after 20% paid

### Loan Term

Simply put, the length of your mortage. How many years will it take you to pay off your mortgage?

* 15 to 30 year terms are the common terms
  * 30 year being industry standard
* Longer term are cheaper, but you pay a lot more interest over the loan term

### Interest Rate Type

1. Fixed Rate
   * Interest Rate never changes \(either up or down\)
   * Easier to budget, and will never rise, but
   * Will never lower if rates go down
   * Monthly payments are typically higher than initial payments on adjustable rate
     * Lenders start higher since they can't ever change
2. Adjustabe Rate
   * Obviously these fluctuate depending on mortgate rates \(nationwide?\)
   * Rules exist for how often the rate can change
     * 5/1 ARMs are most common \(same rate for first 5 years, and adjust only once per year after that\)
   * There are caps on how much the interest rate can change
     * There's an initial cap
     * There are subsequent adj caps
     * Finally a lifetime cap on how much it can increase overall
