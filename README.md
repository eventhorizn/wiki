Just where I document all my personal stuff

# TODO

1. Implement standalone Blazor Movies repo once bootcamp is done
   - Refer to that project's TODO for next steps
1. Develop Book website
   - Amazon search api is 'available to all'. Might be able to use it
   - Could be a blazor app, but I might do nodejs
   - Could also do python, might be my 'go-to' for new website framworks
