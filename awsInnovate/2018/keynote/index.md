# AWS Innovate 2018

I got the impression that this was a presentation for developers.  
- It's a showcase attempting to get buyers, but for a particular group of people.
- I'm not sure the way things work in some companies, but if developers had a lot of pull on what tools they use, if those companies exist, this conference was for them.

**My biggest takeaway is that we should seriously consider AWS**

I was impressed. They have combined a great suite of tools into a single package

Overall impressions...


Of all the issues I've heard from PCAS with our move towards HADOOP and event storing...AWS seems to have answers
 - It's very flexible. That seems to be the idea for most of their products
 - I bounced around a number of paths, and every presentation seemed to focus on the number of outside tools it would support
 - Ideas like, 'you use this system for particular reasons...great! Integrate that system into AWS and you can then do etc...'

## AWS is a huge ecostystem

 - My impression is that they are attempting to be a 'one stop shop'
 - And why not? What's the counter to open source software? Embrace it, but offer stability

The trend I've been seeing with major companies is to apply a specific philosophy to their offerings
 - Develop however you want. A big issue with developers is restrictions on how they develop
  - Security and access to open source offerings
  - Administrator access (why is this even something a anyone worries about?)

## Solutions to Pervasive Problems

- Continous Delevery or Continous Integration seems to be a constant problem.
 -  It's security, obviously, but why is it security? What is the concern. I feel we need to go back to the basics as to why it's so hard to get through firewalls in our systems and see if AWS can solve those problems
- I've just heard this problem, but on the PCAS side, running huge number of events for simulation has been a big problem. From what I remember it's a space issue
 - AWS had examples of companies using AWS for huuge amounts of data  


Open source is awesome!
