## How Mortgages Work

- A mortgage is a secured loan with your home as collateral
    - Lender will hold the title to the property until the loan is paid in full
- You make payments each month, including interest, until it's paid off
- Once paid off, lender gives you the title to the property

There are 4 major decisions to make with a mortgage

1. The Lender
1. The Loan Type
1. Loan Term
1. Interest Rate Type

### The Lender

Usually a bank or credit union

### Mortgage Loan Types

**2 Major Types**

1. Goverment-backed
    - We won't be going w/ a FHA due to high FICA
1. Conventional
    - Contract b/t homebuyers and private lenders
    - Typically require a down payment from 5 to 20 percent
        - Some offer loans w/ 3%
    - Must but PHI (private mortgate insurance) which pays lender if you default
        - Goes away after 20% paid

### Loan Term

Simply put, the length of your mortage. How many years will it take you to pay off your mortgage?

- 15 to 30 year terms are the common terms
    - 30 year being industry standard
- Longer term are cheaper, but you pay a lot more interest over the loan term

### Interest Rate Type

1. Fixed Rate
    - Interest Rate never changes (either up or down)
    - Easier to budget, and will never rise, but
    - Will never lower if rates go down
    - Monthly payments are typically higher than initial payments on adjustable rate
        - Lenders start higher since they can't ever change
1. Adjustabe Rate
    - Obviously these fluctuate depending on mortgate rates (nationwide?)
    - Rules exist for how often the rate can change
        - 5/1 ARMs are most common (same rate for first 5 years, and adjust only once per year after that)
    - There are caps on how much the interest rate can change
        - There's an initial cap
        - There are subsequent adj caps
        - Finally a lifetime cap on how much it can increase overall
